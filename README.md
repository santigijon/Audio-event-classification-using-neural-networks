# Single and Multi-Label Environmental Sound Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks

**A master thesis project by Santiago √Ålvarez-Buylla Puente, carried out at Chalmers University of Technology between January and June 2018, for the MSc Sound and Vibration, ** 

In this repository the code developed during my master theis project ("Single and Multi-Label Environmental Sound Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks") is presented. Several jupyter notebooks and python packages are available, as well as some audio files to make the jupyter notebook more interactive. 


## Content of the repository

In the repository, four Jupyter notebooks can be found:

- Dataset_processing.ipynb
- Dataset_processing_Multilabel.ipynb
- Audio_Classification_Softmax_mine_260318.ipynb
- Audio_Classification_Multilabel_mine_170518.ipynb

And three Python modules:

- santiago_data_preprocessing.py
- santiago_my_modules_v3_160418.py
- santiago_my_modules_v3_17_05_18_Multilabel.py

In the two first Jupyter notebooks, the processing of the dataset is performed and explained, both for the single and the multi-label classification tasks. These two files make use of the Python module *santiago_data_preprocessing.py*  
The two following Jupyter notebooks are the notebooks where the two models are implemented, making use of the two Python modules *santiago_my_modules_v3_160418.py* and *santiago_my_modules_v3_17_05_18_Multilabel.py*


Hope you find it useful.  
Any suggestion is always welcomed!
